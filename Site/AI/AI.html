               AI can perform tasks 
        better than humans.Particularly 
    when it comes to repetitive,detail-
    oriented tasks like analyzing large 
    numbers of legal documents to 
    ensure relevant fields are filled 
    properly,AI tools often complete jobs
        quickly and with relatively 
                     few errors.

                that you hear about today from 
              chess playing computer to self-
           driving cars rely heavily on deep 
         learning and natural language processing.
         Using these technologie,computers can be 
         trained to accomplish specific tasks by 
             processing large amounts of data 
                    and recognizing patterns 
                                in the data.

                This aspect of AI 
    programming focuse on acquiring 
  data & creating rules for how to turn 
 the data into actionable info.The rules 
 which are called algorithms,provide
     computing devices with step-by-
         step instructions for how to 
            complete a specific task.

         <p class="p5">
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956,<br>but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased<br>data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in<br>computing power and storage.<br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took<br>interest in this type of work and began training computers to<br>mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense<br>Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street<br>mapping projects in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent<br>personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana<br>were household names.

  is Deep Blue, the IBM chess
 program that beat Garry 
 Kasparov in the 1990.Deep Blue
can identify pieces on chess-
 board and make predictions,but
 because it has no memory, it

   Theory of mind is a psych-
  ology term. When applied to
 AI, it means that the system
 would have the social intelli-
gence to understand emotions.
 This type of AI will be able to
 infer human intentions and
  predict behavior, a necessary 
  skill for AI system to be an
      integral members of 
           human teams.

        <p class="p8">
           <b><u>AI in healthcare</u>.</b> The biggest bets are on improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known healthcare technologies is IBM Watson. It understands natural language and can respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. Other AI applications include using online virtual health assistants and chatbots to help patients and healthcare customers find medical information, schedule appointments, understand the billing process and complete other administrative processes. An array of AI technologies is also being used to predict, fight and understand pandemics such as COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p class="p9">
           <b><u> AI in business</u></b>. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have been incorporated into websites to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT analysts.
        </p>
            <p class="pA">
                <b><u>AI in manufacturing</u></b>. Manufacturing has been at the forefront of incorporating robots into the workflow. For example, the industrial robots that were at one time programmed to perform single tasks and separated from human workers, increasingly function as cobots: Smaller, multitasking robots that collaborate with humans and take on responsibility for more parts of the job in warehouses, factory floors and other workspaces.
